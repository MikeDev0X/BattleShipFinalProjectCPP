# BattleShipFinalProjectCPP
This is a scholar project.

The project simulates the famous game "battleship", using basic C++ concepts such as classes, methods, headers, objects.

The program starts asking for a maximum number of turns, the subsidence percentage and the name of the two players. 

# HowToPlay
The first step is to enter the coordinates of your shot, the way to enter it is: _<row (from A to J)> <column (from 1 to 10)>_.
In order to exit before finishing the game, the player must enter: < S > < 0 >.

If the turns are over the game will notify you, so if someone wins.

# ENJOY!!
